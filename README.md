# Auto tabs

Submitted as final project for Goldsmiths, University of London, Computer Science BSc 2022

##Abstract
Musical notation is an essential tool for composers and musicians. With it, music can survive for centuries, notation providing the blueprint for symphonies to be reawakened, new styles to be learned and compo- sitions to be analysed. Notation is the data structure we use to archive messages written in our most evocative language, and the best device for this remains to be the human brain. Despite the ongoing automation gold rush, transcribing music is an unsolved challenge, in some part because many sub-tasks exist within this challenge, each of which presenting a unique problem, and each of which associated with a diverse set of solu- tions that will be explicated in this paper. Also contained in the paper is the developmental journey of Tab My Pitch Up, a new software solution designed to produce guitar tablature from guitar performances.
